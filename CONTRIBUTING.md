## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead mail directly to buriyvo@gmail.com.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/matteofabbri/AspNetCore.Identity.Mongo/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/matteofabbri/AspNetCore.Identity.Mongo/issues/new). Be sure to include
a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** (if possible) demonstrating the expected behavior
that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new pull request with the fix.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new GitHub issue and provide as much relevant information as possible why it should be added/changed.

* Do not make a PR until you have received positive feedback about the change.

#### **Dotnet version**

* master branch refers only relevant and supported by Microsoft versions of dotnet.

* older versions will be branched out, so if you want to make changes make sure you selected right branch.
